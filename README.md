The files for [our](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/ion-trap-quantum-computing-group) closed-loop electrically-heated atom source controllers can be found in the following adjacient repositories:

 - [oven-electronics](https://github.com/OxfordIonTrapGroup/oven-electronics) for the printed circuit board design files,
 - [oven-hardware](https://github.com/OxfordIonTrapGroup/oven-hardware) for the in-vacuum assembly CAD files, and
 - [oven-software](https://github.com/OxfordIonTrapGroup/oven-software) for the microcontroller firmware, calibration scripts, and the [ARTIQ](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq) interface.
 
 This repository remains as a placeholder, as it was referenced in our related journal article, [Ballance et al., _A short response time atomic source for trapped ion experiments_ (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5025713).
